# ML_Turrets
A project to use machine learning techniques to create ant colony intelligence turrets

## Machine learning techniques
The current version of this project, uses a genetic algorithm, as the levels increase and the amount of turrets increase, each level runs a set of simulations, choosing the most successful turrets and duplicating these for the next level, using these turrets as a base to create the next generation.
